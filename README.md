A demo of Java Reflection

Dr Gary Allen, The University of Huddersfield

This demo is heavily based upon the one at:
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reflection-in-java/

Simply import the code into IntelliJ (or another IDE) and run the ReflectionDemo class.

Note - I have now added another demo here that scans a filesystem hierarchy (from a root specified as an argument to main) finding all class files and analysing them one by one.  This demo is NOT complete and is still work in progress.  Try passing the root folder of an IntelliJ project as the argument.  The project can analyse itself.
